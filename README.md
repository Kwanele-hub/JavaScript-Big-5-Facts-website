I am creating a JavaScript Big 5 Facts website 
that will allow people to view details of the South African big 5 animals.
 That must have a view of the list of the big 5 animals and when you click on each,
  it should take to a details view of that selected animal. That will Neatly display all relevant details about that animal. When you hover over the image of the animal it should play a corresponding sound of that animal.
 My website must also be responsive and render neatly on mobile devices
